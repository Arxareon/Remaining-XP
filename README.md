***A simple solution to a simple problem:*** Remaining XP displays the amount of XP needed to reach the next level in a small movable text display (hidden for max level characters).

# Features
* Use the **/remxp** chat command to see details about setting and saving display positions, hide/show or toggle the display.
* Use **Shift + Click & drag** to reposition the XP display anywhere you like.
* After you move it, you can save its location as your own preset position via chat commands. If you change the preset, you can quickly set up the location on your characters without having to drag the addon in just the right place for every character of yours. (The default preset location is the rightmost side of the default XP bar - if the Bottom Right Bar is enabled).
* Includes multi-version support for Retail, Classic and Burning Crusade Classic!
